# contribution-days

This project is a personal exercise to practice image parsing and recognition in Python. Its primary function is to analyze GitHub contribution graphs and determine the number of days with contributions.

### How It Works
- Upload an image of a GitHub contribution graph.
- The tool processes the grid and calculates the number of active contribution days.

### Requirements for Input
- Ensure the uploaded image contains only the grid section of the contribution graph without any additional elements.
- Here's an example of a valid input image:
